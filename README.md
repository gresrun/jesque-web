Jesque-Web
==========

Jesque-Web is a faithful re-implementation of the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) web application, resque-web, that is a part of [Resque](https://github.com/defunkt/resque) in [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html).

Jesque-Web is a [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) project built using [Spring MVC](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html) and depends on [Jesque](https://github.com/gresrun/jesque), [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis) to connect to [Redis](http://redis.io/), [Jackson](http://jackson.codehaus.org/) to map to/from [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/) for logging.

How do I use it?
----------------
Download the latest source at:

	https://github.com/gresrun/jesque-web
Build the WAR and start Jetty:

	mvn clean jetty:run
***
If you get 
> No plugin found for prefix 'jetty' in the current project and in the plugin groups [org.apache.maven.plugins, org.codehaus.mojo] available from the repositories ...

Running maven 3.x you could try 

	mvn org.mortbay.jetty:maven-jetty-plugin:run

Misc.
-----

If you are on Mac OS X, I highly recommend using the fantasic [Homebrew package manager](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew). It makes installing and maintaining libraries, tools and applications a cinch. E.g.:

	brew install redis
	brew install git
	brew install maven
	gem install resque
Boom! Ready to go!
